## Sample Data

The code uses the digits dataset from scikit-learn to demonstrate the dimensionality reduction techniques. The dataset consists of images of handwritten digits.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run the `pca_vs_tsne.py` script using Python to visualize PCA and t-SNE comparisons.
4. Observe the generated visualizations and how each technique represents the high-dimensional data in 2D.
